# Success

Being a contractor is like courting an amnesiac. Each client has different tasks but the destination is always profits. Untold riches, validation, and respect in the industry.

I've never been told a client is looking for a miserly success. Not once. Maybe the alternative is just boring, or maybe a humble success story is just depressing. We all crave a grand tale of going against all odds, facing insurmountable opposition, and hard lessons learned.

Your peers smiling, your dissenters gnashing. Repeat after me,

>You are valid.
>
>*You were right a majority of the time!*
>*You see things that others don't.*
>*You hold fast where others falter!*

Apparently it takes a public enterprise to capture success.

Which is worse, those who saw success and failed, or those who never tried? Who comforts the losers? The average?

## Madness

Indeed, there's no room for a tale of humble success. I can't think of a more apt irony than an industry of me-tooers demanding extraordinary success. An industry who builds taller labyrinths and demands the world conform to its madness.

Deep, deep, under the lacquered facade lies true success. The only ill fitting definition of success is prescribed by another looking for their own.

Show the universe what makes you, you.
